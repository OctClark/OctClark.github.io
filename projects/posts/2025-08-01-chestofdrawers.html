    <h1>
        Refurbishing my chest of drawers
    </h1>

        So finally finished my summer project - it can rain now, I don't mind anymore - and I have
        a lovely new-looking chest of drawers, without the remains of stickers my 8-year old self added.
        <br>Note to Self: Paint stripper coverage varies quite a bit - don't go for the cheapest brand,
        it's much less fierce.

        Anyway, I haven't managed to find photos of what it looked like before, but imagine it being white,
        chipped, and holding the remains of decade-old (at least) primary school stickers. Yes, I did feel a
        little melancholic removing those stickers. So here are the 'in process' and 'after' photos:
