        So finally finished my summer project - it can rain now, I don't mind anymore - and I have 
        a lovely new-looking chest of drawers, without the remains of stickers my 8-year old self added.
        <br>Note to Self: Paint stripper coverage varies quite a bit - don't go for the cheapest brand, 
        it's much less fierce.
