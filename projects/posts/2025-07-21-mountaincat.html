        A Landscape Cat

        Inspired by artist Lim Heng Swee who creates beautiful digital artworks of cats camouflaged as landscapes, I decided
        to use my relatively new Inkscape skills to combine a copy of my brother's cat with a recent photo of him in taken in
        the Lake District.
