    <h2>Pocket Projects Intro</h2>

    <p>
        So today I started on a project that I've been meaning to for a while; a website. One to keep track of the many little 'pocket projects' that I apparently can't help myself from starting, from the very basic to the 'you are never going to finish this'.
    </p>



    <p>
        This website is started with three basic aims:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>To keep track of my in-process (still) projects.</li>
        <li>To keep track of the finished projects that I've given away or were sadly for other people.</li>
        <li>To learn and practice HTML. Yes this is the first time I've ever used HTML. Look a list! </li>
    </ol>
