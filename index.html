<h1>Pocket Projects </h1>
<h2>Pocket Projects Intro</h2>

<p>
Started: 16th July 2025
</p>

<p>
So today I started on a project that I've been meaning to for a while; a website. One to keep track of the many little 'pocket projects' that I apparently can't help myself from starting, from the very basic to the 'you are never going to finish this'.
</p>



<p>
This website is started with three basic aims:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>To keep track of my in-process (still) projects.</li>
  <li>To keep track of the finished projects that I've given away or were sadly for other people.</li>
  <li>To learn and practice HTML. Yes this is the first time I've ever used HTML. Look a list! </li>
</ol> 

<h2>
Projects (both ongoing and to upload here!)
</h2>
<ul>
  <li>this website</li>
  <li>Refurbishing chest of drawers</li>
  <li>Mountain cat shirt</li>
  <li>Dogs shirt</li>
  <li>...</li>
</ul>
